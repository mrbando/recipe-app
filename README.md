## Recipe CRUD App ##

#### In this project, you will build the interface for a Recipe CRUD App. CRUD (create, read, update and delete) refers to the four functions that are necessary to implement a storage application.

#### The app will allow a user to create new entries (create function), it will also allow a user to display a list of recipes (read function). Each entry will have an update button that will allow a user to edit the information of a recipe (update function). A user will also be able to delete a recipe from the list (delete function).


#### This project has starter code you can use for the application. You will need to add handlers and other logic to make this code work.

### Specific Instructions

#### Find the TODO comments in the code and create the necessary functionality. Below is a list of specific items you will need to complete for this checkpoint.

#### App will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (edit and delete).

#### Create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.

#### It does not need to match the appearance of the example image, but should have a reasonable layout.

#### Add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed.

#### To create a recipe entry, your app will need to have a form with input fields for the name of the dish, the cuisine it belongs to, and an URL that points to a picture of the dish. Use <textarea> for the ingredients and preparation. For the tests to pass, use the following names for your inputs: <input name="name">, <input name="cuisine">, <input name="photo">, <textarea name="ingredients"> and <textarea name="preparation">.
